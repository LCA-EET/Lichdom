# So, you wanna be a Lich.
You're in the right place!  You're also late to the party.

_Szass Tam, the Famous Necromancer Lich of Thay_

Throughout the realms and the planes, many have already become Liches or Demiliches of some sort.  Perhaps they sought immortality.  Perhaps they had enough of  needing to eat and breathe.  Perhaps they were tired of being chilled, shocked, diseased, entangled, level drained, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, polymorphed into squirrels, stunned, and webbed.

Regardless of their reasoning, with this mod, you too can become a Lich with the help of Gravetender Morris in Athkatla's Graveyard District (SoA) or Saradush (ToB).  You have plenty of chances to decline, but because you came here, I assume you seek the secrets of a Lich transformation as performed by Gravetender Morris.

# Requirements for Lichdom
- Level 12 or higher in any casting class or kit.  This applies to Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Shaman, Sorcerer, and Wizard (Mage).  Multiclassed or dual classed characters need at least 12 levels in one of these classes to undergo the ritual.

- 120,000G per transformation.  (This amount is configurable.)

- The chosen character may be of any alignment, but their alignment will turn into the Evil version of this alignment.  Thus, LG/LN/LE become LE; NG/TN/NE become NE; and CG/CN/CE become CE.  This alignment change may disqualify this character from their current class, such as a Paladin becoming an Ex-Paladin or a Ranger becoming an Ex-Ranger.

- Note that many recruitable NPCs simply refuse to undergo this Lichdom ritual for personal reasons.  (This too is configurable if you just want to ignore the story ramifications of Valygar, Minsc, and Jaheira becoming Liches, for example.)

- A series of tasks given by Gravetender Morris.  Notably, you will need at least 3 Lich Dusts (a new key item from this mod) from the corpses of Alhoons, Liches, and Demiliches.  (This item is droppable, but unstealable.)  If Dracoliches were in the game, they would also carry Lich Dust.

- The character can't have the Undead flag active.  Thus, for example, Hexxat isn't eligible because of this.

- The character's soul must be in their body.

- Accepting the strong possibility that this process is irreversible.

# Effects of Lichdom (Default)
- Since the process of Lichdom is so varied within D&D's decades of canon, and much of it is left to intrepretation, various aspects of Lichdom are configurable in-game via **WHAT METHOD?**.  

- The default effects and requirements were heavily inspired by [Liches in _Baldur's Gate_](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Lich) as well as [3.5's Liches](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/lich.htm).

- Immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons.

- Immune (100% resistant) to HP damage from cold, electricity, and poison.

- Immune to the negative statuses of Berserk, Charm, Confusion, Domination, Disease, Fatigue/Exhaustion, Fear, Grease, Entangle, Hold/Paralysis, Level Drain/Negative Levels, Petrification, Polymorph Other, Sleep/Unconsciousness, Stun, and Web.  Also immune to at least most instant death effects such as Disintegrate and Finger of Death.

- Continual Detect Invisibliity.

- +1 to INT, WIS, and CHA scores.

- Natural AC improves by 3.

- You gain the innate ability of Lich Touch, usable at will but only once per turn.  Lich Touch deals d10 cold damage in melee range (no save), and the subject must save vs. paralysis or be paralyzed for 5 rounds.  Undead and other subjects immune to paralysis are immune to Lich Touch, and spell resistance applies.

- Unlike a typical Lich in BG2, you have no racial immunity to spells of a certain level.

- All Liches start with their phylactery - a cloak called the Shroud of the Lich.  This shroud is unstealable and undroppable.  (For technical reasons, the Lich's abilities are put onto an item instead of something else like a slotless script.)

- The UI changes your displayed race to Lich.  Mechanically, you're still a member of your original race such as Human or Gnome.

# Configurable Lichdom Options
Since Lichdom's requirements and effects throughout the editions and decades of D&D have varied so much, it seemed fitting to include a variety of options to better suit your play style.

# Q & A (FAQ)
**How lore friendly is this mod?**
- While I tried to make the premise of this mod fit within existing Faerun and _Baldur's Gate_ series lore, I am not sure off-hand how accurate this is.  The plot makes a big deal about certain characters dying, but Imoen can die and be raised freely in the games with no long-term story impact.  Let's just say BioWare - and, by extension, BeamDog - were inconsitent in their writing in this regard.

NPCs the world over were NOT recoded to treat characters drastically differently after becoming a Lich.  In vanilla BG2, you could walk fairly freely through the streets and countrysides of Amn with a [vampire](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Hexxat), a [drow](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Viconia_DeVir), and a [cackling Red Wizard](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Edwin) spamming [undead animating spells](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Animate_Dead_(wizard)) and NPCs would probably complain most about the drow, not the small army that acts as a Faerunian version of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) in their midst.

Ultimately, this Lichdom mod is mostly about the mechanical side of being a Lich.  If you want a game that was built from the ground up to account for NPCs' reactions to becoming a Lich and the associated necromancy, play [_Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous__Enhanced_Edition/) or another such game, if that exists.
