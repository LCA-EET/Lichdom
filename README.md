![If you wanna be a lich, this is the right place!](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/2/2e/Runestonecarverns.png/revision/latest?cb=20191004102509)

# So, you wanna be a Lich
You're in the right place!  You're also late to the party.

Throughout the realms and the planes, many have already become Liches or Demiliches of some sort.  Perhaps they sought immortality.  Perhaps they had enough of  needing to eat and breathe.  Perhaps they were tired of being chilled, shocked, diseased, entangled, level drained, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, polymorphed into squirrels, stunned, and webbed.

Regardless of their reasoning, with this mod, you too can become a Lich with the help of Gravetender Morris in Athkatla's Graveyard District (SoA) or Saradush (ToB).  You have plenty of chances to decline, but because you came here, I assume you seek the secrets of a Lich transformation as performed by Gravetender Morris.

# Requirements for Lichdom
- Level 12 or higher in any casting class or kit.  This applies to Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Shaman, Sorcerer, and Wizard (Mage).  Multiclassed or dual classed characters need at least 12 levels in one of these classes to undergo the ritual.

- 120,000G per transformation.  (This amount is configurable.)

- The chosen character may be of any alignment, but their alignment will turn into the Evil version of this alignment.  Thus, LG/LN/LE become LE; NG/TN/NE become NE; and CG/CN/CE become CE.  This alignment change may disqualify this character from their current class, such as a Paladin becoming an Ex-Paladin or a Ranger becoming an Ex-Ranger.

- Note that many recruitable NPCs simply refuse to undergo this Lichdom ritual for personal reasons.  (This too is configurable if you just want to ignore the story ramifications of Valygar, Minsc, and Jaheira becoming Liches, for example.)

- A series of tasks given by Gravetender Morris.  Notably, you will need at least 3 Lich Dusts (a new item from this mod) from the corpses of Alhoons, Liches, and Demiliches.  (This item is droppable, but unstealable.)
