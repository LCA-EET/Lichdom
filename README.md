![If you wanna be a lich, this is the right place!](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/2/2e/Runestonecarverns.png/revision/latest?cb=20191004102509)

# So, you wanna be a Lich
You're in the right place!  You're also late to the party.

Throughout the realms and the planes, many have already become Liches or Demiliches of some sort.  Perhaps they sought immortality.  Perhaps they had enough of  needing to eat and breathe.  Perhaps they were tired of being chilled, shocked, diseased, entangled, level drained, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, polymorphed into squirrels, stunned, and webbed.

Regardless of their reasoning, with this mod, you too can become a Lich with the help of Gravetender Morris in Athkatla's Graveyard District (SoA) or Saradush (ToB).  You have plenty of chances to decline, but because you come here, I assume you seek the secrets of a Lich transformation as performed by Gravetender Morris.
